## Abstract

Cooperation is fundamental to human societies.
While several basic theoretical mechanisms underlying its evolution have been established, research addressing more realistic settings remains underdeveloped.
Based on the hypothesis that intensified environmental fluctuations drove early human behavioral evolution during the Middle Stone Age in Africa, we examine the effects of environmental variability and human mobility on the evolution of cooperation.
In our model, the variability is represented as randomly moving resource-rich spots across a two-dimensional space, and the mobility is represented as resource-seeking migration of agents.
These agents interact cooperatively or competitively for resources while adopting the behavior of more resource-rich neighbors.
Through extensive simulations on this model, we reveal three key findings:
(i) With sufficient agent mobility, even modest environmental variability promotes cooperation, but further variability does not enhance cooperation;
(ii) With any level of environmental variability, agent mobility promotes cooperation; and
(iii) These effects occur because the joint effect of environmental variability and agent mobility disrupts defector groups in resource-rich areas, forming cooperator groups on those sites.
Although previous studies examine environmental variability and mobility separately, this research first reveals how both factors together affect the evolution of cooperation.
These findings suggest that environmental variability can promote cooperative group formation without enhanced cognitive abilities, providing new insights into the evolution of human cooperation and, by extension, sociality.
